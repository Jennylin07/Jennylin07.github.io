    <p class="life-span">"There are many <strong>breeds of rabbits.</strong> Just like with dogs, each has a different lifespan.
        In general, larger rabbit breeds live shorter lives than dwarf breeds, and purebred rabbits have shorter lives than mixed breeds.
        But each rabbit is different; a large purebred rabbit may live up to <strong>10 years,</strong> while a mixed-breed dwarf rabbit may only live <em>eight</em>." </p>

    <h4 class="Yum">Supplies</h4>
    <div>
        <p><span id="supplies"> It's so simple! You simply need just a roomy cage just a little big bit bigger, so the rabbit can move around. It need's a litter box and pellet bowl just in case it needs to pee or poop.
            Give it a water bottle, so it does not thrist to death! Provide some toys for the rabbit to play with, so it does not die from boredom.</span></p>

    <h5 class="Yum">Remember to brush your rabbit!</h5>
    <p class="Brush">First, calm down your rabbit, so it's not scared. Place it on a towel or your lap. Gently brush with a soft comb the direction of the fur and remember to pluck out the loose fur. Then, brush off any excess fur! </p>
